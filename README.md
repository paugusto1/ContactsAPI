# ContactAPI - Pedro Augusto Vicente

ContactsAPI is a RESTFul API to manage contacts.



## Authors

- Pedro Augusto Vicente (pedro-augusto32@hotmail)


## Features

- Create new contacts.
- Search contacts by fields.
- List all contacts.
- Delete contacts.
- Update existing contact.


## Notes

This was the first time I had the opportunity to directly develop an API.
 
As Python is the language I am more familiar with, it was the direct option. First, i looked up 
for Frameworks that could support the development. FastAPI was the choice, mainly because 
there are a good documentation i could use to learn 
about the tool.
 
Also, the use of the Pydantic module was a facilitator to do the Data validation.
 
I got a little excited and also did a Web Client Application using Python (Flask Framework)
to use the ContactAPI. This was also a great opportunity to exercise with different skills that,
as a QA/PO, is not always my main role.  
 
For persistence, AWS Relational Database Service is being used. Data representation can be 
checked below. As we are talking about a simple Contact register i considered that maybe a NoSQL document based 
approach could be used but i went with the relational option.
 
Database, Web Client Application and API are hosted by different AWS cloud services. The last
two are available for online evaluation (Check Demo section)

## Assumptions

- ContactAPI has support for Contacts with (O..N) numbers of emails, phone numbers and addresses. 
- We are considering Contacts from Brazil. Therefore, phone numbers and addresses should use brazilian patterns.
- Profile image is a URL with the most common image type extensions.
- Only one contact with same First and Last names can be included.
- For more details about the implementation check the documentation and inline comments.
